Statistical Modelling and Predictive Analysis Portfolio
I conducted advanced statistical analysis across three real-world datasets — Wine Quality, Melbourne Housing, and IBM HR Attrition — to examine how different predictors influence quality ratings, housing prices, and employee turnover. Using R, I applied multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and independent samples t-tests to model outcomes and test hypotheses.

I validated key assumptions such as multicollinearity and linearity using tools like ggpairs, Q-Q plots, and VIF. For the Melbourne housing dataset, I addressed missing data using median imputation and transformed inconsistent variables to enable proper analysis. In the HR dataset, I used logistic regression to predict attrition based on income and commuting distance.

Key insights included:

Alcohol and volatile acidity strongly predicted wine quality

Number of rooms and proximity to the city impacted house pricing

Monthly income and distance from home were major attrition drivers

This portfolio sharpened my ability to frame research questions, clean and model data, test statistical assumptions, and communicate insights across multiple business domains.
