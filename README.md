# Statistical Modelling and Predictive Analysis Portfolio

This project showcases applied statistical analysis using real-world datasets across wine quality, housing prices, and employee attrition. Using R and its packages, I explored predictors, validated assumptions, and built models that support data-informed decision-making.

## Datasets Covered
- Wine Quality Dataset (UCI)
- Melbourne Housing Dataset
- IBM HR Attrition Dataset

## Techniques Applied
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Independent Samples t-tests
- Hypothesis Testing
- Data Cleaning & Imputation
- Diagnostic Testing (VIF, Q-Q Plots, Linearity)

## Key Insights
- Wine Quality: Alcohol and volatile acidity are strong predictors of quality scores.
- Housing: Number of rooms and proximity to the city drive price variations.
- HR Attrition: Monthly income and commuting distance are key turnover indicators.

## Tools Used
R | tidyverse | GGally | car | ggpairs | Statistical Inference
